Question,Answer
What is the Central Limit Theorem?,"The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution."
How can outlier values be treated?,"Outlier values can be treated by either removing them if they are due to errors or extreme noise, or by transforming them using techniques like winsorization or logarithmic transformation."
Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning.,"Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data."
Explain confidence intervals.,Confidence intervals are a range of values calculated from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate.
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data where each input-output pair is provided, and the model learns to predict the output from the input data. In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data and aims to find hidden patterns or structures in the data."
