Question,Answer
What is deep learning and how does it differ from traditional machine learning?,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. It differs from traditional machine learning by automatically learning features from the data rather than relying on manual feature engineering.
What are some common techniques for dimensionality reduction?,"Common techniques for dimensionality reduction include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). These techniques aim to reduce the number of features while preserving the most important information in the data."
What are the feature selection methods used to select the right variables?,"Feature selection methods include filter methods (e.g., correlation-based feature selection), wrapper methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination), and embedded methods (e.g., Lasso regression). These methods aim to select the most relevant features for improving model performance."
"Facebook composer, the posting tool, dropped from 3% posts per user last month to 2.5% posts per user today. How would you investigate what happened?","To investigate the drop in post percentage, you can analyze various factors such as changes in user behavior, platform algorithms, posting frequency, or external factors like competition or market trends. Conducting A/B testing or user surveys can also provide insights into the cause of the drop."
"If the labels are known in a clustering project, how would you evaluate the performance of the model?","If the labels are known, you can use evaluation metrics like Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Mutual Information Score (MI), or Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI) to measure the similarity between the true labels and the cluster assignments generated by the model. These metrics assess the quality of clustering without relying on the actual labels."
