Question,Answer
What is regularization in machine learning?,"Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages overly complex models. It helps to generalize the model to new, unseen data."
Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.,"The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between the model's ability to capture the true underlying pattern in the data (bias) and its sensitivity to variations in the training data (variance). A model with high bias may underfit the data, while a model with high variance may overfit the data."
What are the assumptions of linear regression?,"The assumptions of linear regression include linearity (relationship between variables is linear), independence of errors (residuals are independent), homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals), and normality of errors (residuals are normally distributed)."
What is the significance of p-value?,"The p-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis in a statistical hypothesis test. It indicates the probability of observing the test results, or more extreme results, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true."
You are given a data set consisting of variables with more than 30 percent missing values. How will you deal with them?,"There are several methods to deal with missing values, including imputation (replacing missing values with a calculated value), deletion (removing observations or variables with missing values), or using advanced techniques like multiple imputation or predictive modeling."
